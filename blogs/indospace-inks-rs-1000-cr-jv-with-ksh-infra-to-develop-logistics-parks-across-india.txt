<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->17:Tbd9,<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted every single industry over the course of just a few months. It has completely changed human life, irrespective of demographics, profession and social status. Many of our habits have changed. Our lifestyle, social connect and work culture have mutated beyond reckoning. While economic slowdown brews on one end, new trends are evolving on the other. A new world is emerging…one that might finally accept that ‘abnormal’ is the ‘new normal’.</p>
<p>While world economies were shaken by the Coronavirus, many industries in India took a hit as well. Lower production, pay reduction and high job &#038; business uncertainty have been spooking every tax paying citizen ever since the onset of the pandemic. But in some sectors, the results are exponentially positive. So adaptability and creative decision making will play a key role in the future sustainability of enterprises.</p>
<p>Many countries, including India, have started resuming work in a tamed environment. India could potentially lead the change in a post-Covid world with its vast array of engineers and investment opportunities, according to billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban. India could be the next biggest global exporter as many countries are looking to shift operations and this is a real opportunity for diversification for India. In such a case, manufacturing companies in India must quickly adapt to the global demands, diversify their supply chain and focusing on product quality. Every sector will have to reinvent itself to survive in a post-COVID-19 world order.<br />
Several companies that incorporated the work-from-home system have now decided to continue it even post lockdown. From delivering work stations to providing high speed internet connectivity, every company working in the digital and tech space has ensured a smooth transition of work culture. This has not just saved on operational costs but also increased productivity. Such transition may never be possible in the manufacturing sectors, however, innovative systems may be designed to enhance processes that do not require physical presence.</p>
<p>India has become the new land of opportunities as foreign companies look to shift base out of other asian counties and into India. As entrepreneurs, we must work along with our government to create internationally acclaimed benchmarks in manufacturing and distribution to portray reliability and attract foreign investments. Expanding domestic capacity and capability in a strategic manner can make all the difference. With a youth population of nearly 230 million, man power and skilled labour can serve as our greatest strengths.</p>
<p><strong>In summary, manufacturing companies need to articulate a measurable roadmap to increase their current domestic value addition. A strategic approach, technological enhancement, skill development and precise market forecast are some of the key focus areas to make India the next preferred global industrial destination post COVID-19.</strong></p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->1b:Tcdb,<p>There is no debating the fact that modern buildings put tremendous pressure on the environment. Existing buildings today consume 40 percent of the total electricity globally and generate 19 percent of energy-related GHG emissions. It is therefore essential to adopt green building techniques. As human life came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the earth initiated a self-healing process. Cleaner water, clearer skies, low seismic activities and the influx of wildlife into human habitats are clear indicators of how rapid development was hampering the existence of our natural world and that nature does not need to be saved, only preserved. When the world resumes, we should remember what we owe our planet and embrace a sustainable future.</p>
<p>KSH Chakan Park 2 is among only a few industrial parks in Pune that offer ecologically sustainable infrastructure. All 5 buildings within the park have been preliminarily assessed and certified by Excellence In Design For Greater Efficiencies (EDGE). The projected savings would not just cut down on the pressure that is building on the environment each day, but also reduce operational costs drastically. In addition to this, KSH would also be planting over 1000 trees within the premises to create a fresh and aesthetically appealing work environment.</p>
<h2>LET US BRIEFLY UNDERSTAND HOW KSH INFRA’S SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIAL PARKS CAN BENEFIT YOU AS AN END USER.</h2>
<p><strong>Reduced Operational Costs</strong><br />
Green buildings are designed to enable maximum illumination through natural light during the day, while low consumption LED lights are installed to fill-in when required. Similarly, water-efficient urinals and faucets optimize the use of water with little to no wastage. This results in significant savings through reduced energy and water bills over the life of the building.</p>
<p><strong>Refreshing Workspaces</strong><br />
Ample natural light and ventilation within buildings would create a pleasant and healthy indoor environment for the building occupants. As mentioned above, over a 1000 trees would be planted within the premises of the park, which in turn would result in a lush green and refreshing outdoor ambience. This is likely to improve the productivity of employees and benefit the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Social Image</strong><br />
Manufacturing companies often come under scrutiny due to high emission and energy consumption which many environmentalists and social activists criticize. Consumer behavior is largely affected by a brand’s reputation and its empathy towards the environment. We often see individuals praising or slating organizations for their ethical responsiveness. Moving into a sustainable industrial park exudes a company’s responsibility towards the environment and places it above blatant profiteering firms, thus creating higher value for investors and consumers alike.<br />
Building a sustainable facility is no easy task. Besides procuring land and securing permissions, a proficient team of engineers, architects and technicians with experience in green building must be assigned to the task. So why bother with all the hassles? Opt for a ready to move <strong>sustainable industrial park</strong> developed by KSH Infra at Chakan Pune.</p>
