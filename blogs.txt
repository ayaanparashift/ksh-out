13:T187a,<h2>Introduction: Urbanisation Meets Sustainability</h2>
<p>India is undergoing one of the most rapid urban transformations in human history. <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/india-energy-outlook-2021/urbanisation-and-industrialisation-in-india?utm_source=chatgpt.com">By 2040, more than 270 million people are expected to move to urban areas</a> — adding the equivalent of a new Los Angeles every year. While cities expand, the need for sustainable infrastructure becomes urgent. <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/how-industrial-parks-drive-local-economic-growth-in-india/">Industrial and logistics parks</a> must now address climate risks, resource scarcity, and environmental health, all while supporting economic growth. Here&#8217;s why <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/">“green” Grade A parks</a> are becoming essential — and how KSH INFRA is leading the change.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Park “Grade A”?</h2>
<p>A Grade A industrial or logistics park delivers world-class infrastructure, but modern expectations go beyond just quality construction:</p>
<p>&#8211; Energy efficiency and renewable integration (e.g., <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/sustainability/">IGBC</a>, EDGE certifications)<br />
&#8211; Advanced water management (STPs, rainwater harvesting, sewage recycling)<br />
&#8211; Durable, low-carbon building materials<br />
&#8211; Fire safety, smart energy systems, and efficient waste management</p>
<p>Most KSH INFRA’s have achieved these standards:</p>
<p><strong>Chakan Park II:</strong> EDGE Certified — showcasing global benchmarks for resource efficiency<br />
<strong>Chakan Park III:</strong> IGBC Platinum pre-certified — a green logistics milestone<br />
<strong>Chakan Park IV:</strong> IGBC Platinum pre-certified — a green logistics milestone</p>
<p>These certifications aren’t merely labels — they signal energy savings, operational resilience, lower lifecycle costs, and a healthier industrial ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Core Elements of a Sustainable Industrial Park</h2>
<p><strong>Green Grade A parks function like eco‑communities. KSH INFRA’s approach covers the full spectrum:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Energy:</strong> Solar-ready layouts, intelligent energy management systems, and smart power monitoring<br />
<strong>Water:</strong> Rainwater harvesting and sewage recycling through STP, ensuring responsible water use<br />
<strong>Materials &amp; Waste:</strong> From low‑carbon building materials to structured waste segregation and effluent treatment systems</p>
<p>These systems not only reduce carbon footprints — they set new operational standards for partners and communities.</p>
<h2>Addressing Urbanisation Through Sustainable Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Rapid densification of cities has come at the cost of green space. For example, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-sees-34-decline-in-carbon-sequestration-as-urban-sprawl-reduces-green-cover/articleshow/121398801.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Pune lost 34% of its carbon-sequestering vegetation between 2013 and 2022 due to urban sprawl</a>. With industrial expansion following population growth, the challenge is ensuring development does not deepen ecological harm.</p>
<p><strong>KSH INFRA’s model directly responds to this:</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Aligning parks with national corridor initiatives<br />
&#8211; Delivering carbon-neutral industrial ecosystems<br />
&#8211; Providing smart, resilient infrastructure suited for urban edge growth</p>
<p>Such parks aren’t just located near cities — they are designed to strengthen the cities themselves.</p>
<h2>KSH INFRA in Action: Chakan (Pune) &amp; Hosur</h2>
<p><strong>Chakan, Pune</strong><br />
Once a small industrial hub, <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/ksh-chakan-i/">Chakan</a> has evolved into a sprawling nexus of automotive, logistics, and warehousing ventures. Infrastructure including metro expansion and highway upgrades is in progress.</p>
<p>KSH INFRA’s developments here — especially Park II and III — crucially include Grade A sustainability features, making them a cornerstone of green industrial urbanisation.</p>
<p><strong>Hosur, Tamil Nadu</strong><br />
Bordering Bangalore, Hosur offers strategic access to tech talent and ports without metro congestion. Though still emerging compared to Pune, KSH INFRA is laying the groundwork for green industrial ecosystems in this high-potential region.</p>
<h2>Purpose, Vision &amp; Leadership</h2>
<p>KSH INFRA’s guiding principles resonate with their actions:</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> “Reimagining and inspiring a green industrial future by focusing efforts on developing sustainable industrial and warehousing infrastructure.”<br />
<strong>Vision:</strong> “Creating highly functional, transformative, carbon-neutral, and sustainable warehousing and industrial park solutions across key markets in India.”</p>
<p>These are not mere words — their IGBC Platinum and EDGE certifications at Chakan demonstrate real-world commitment.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead: The Road to a Greener Industrial India</h2>
<p>Industrial development is expanding into new markets—Pune, Hosur, and beyond. As India marches toward $5 trillion GDP, sustainable industrial parks will be vital infrastructure pillars. Success hinges on:</p>
<p><strong>Embedding sustainability early:</strong> From planning through execution<br />
Scaling smart systems: Energy, water, waste, and digital integrations<br />
<strong>Fostering local impact:</strong> Upskilling communities, improving livelihoods</p>
<p>KSH INFRA’s roadmap across these markets shows how green Grade A parks can evolve into urban infrastructure hubs — not just industrial clusters.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: A Green Foundation for Urban Growth</h2>
<p>India’s future cities depend not only on housing and roads—but on sustainable industrial ecosystems that support growth without environmental compromise.</p>
<p>KSH INFRA’s Grade A, green-certified parks are at the center of this transformation. With vision-aligned purpose, actionable leadership, and flagship projects in Pune and Hosur, they are proving exactly how industrial parks can support India’s sustainable urban future.</p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->15:T1e7c,<p>As India positions itself as a global manufacturing and supply chain hub, operational efficiency has become a critical business advantage. Companies are now looking beyond just warehousing space — they need smart, scalable, and sustainable environments that enhance performance and minimize downtime. This is where KSH INFRA’s <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/the-evolution-of-grade-a-industrial-and-logistics-parks-trends-and-insights/">Grade A industrial and logistics parks</a> are setting a new benchmark for infrastructure-led operational success. Designed specifically for high-performance industrial operations, KSH INFRA’s parks in Pune’s <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/ksh-chakan-i/">Chakan</a> region and Hosur, Tamil Nadu are engineered to drive real efficiencies — from faster turnaround times and optimized workflows to energy savings and long-term <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/sustainability-in-industrial-infrastructure-driving-green-development-at-ksh-infra/">sustainability</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Strategic Locations that Reduce Lead Time and Improve Market Access</h2>
<p>One of the foundational elements of operational efficiency is location. KSH INFRA’s developments are strategically located in India’s most promising industrial growth corridors, ensuring tenants are always in the vicinity of business-favourable industrial zones. For instance, the <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/ksh-chakan-ii/">Chakan</a> industrial area in Pune offers immediate access to the Mumbai–Pune Expressway and key highways, enabling quick movement of goods to and from Maharashtra’s consumption and export markets. Similarly, KSH INFRA’s parks in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, are situated near Bengaluru — India’s technology capital — allowing businesses to tap into a dual advantage of industrial-friendly policies in Tamil Nadu and talent access from Karnataka. This strategic connectivity leads to lower freight costs, faster last-mile delivery, and easier integration with supply chains across western and southern India.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Built-to-Perform Infrastructure that Elevates Daily Operations</h2>
<p>Every element of KSH INFRA’s park infrastructure is designed with the end user in mind — companies that need to move fast, grow flexibly, and operate reliably. The warehouses and factory shells are engineered with high floor load capacities, high roof clearance, and optimized circulation paths that support heavy-duty equipment, automated storage solutions, and rapid material movement. The parks are not just pre-approved and ready for occupation; they are also customizable under KSH INFRA’s Build-to-Suit model, giving tenants the ability to design operational layouts that match their unique business flows. Whether it’s a large-scale logistics hub, a light <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/grade-a-industrial-parks-like-ksh-chakan-park-iii-are-modernizing-indias-manufacturing-sector-by-providing-eco-friendly-and-efficient-facilities/">manufacturing facility</a>, or a regional distribution center, businesses can tailor the infrastructure for maximum efficiency right from day one.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Reliable Power, Water, and Park Services That Minimize Disruptions</h2>
<p>In industries where even minor disruptions can cause cascading delays, reliability is everything. That’s why KSH INFRA ensures that critical utilities like electricity, water, and safety systems are not just available but future-ready. Parks are supported by 100% generator backup for external infrastructure and park-wide utilities. Power lines, substations, and water treatment systems are built with redundancy, so operations continue uninterrupted even during peak loads or seasonal disruptions. Advanced fire safety systems and round-the-clock surveillance, supported by a dedicated on-site facility management team, ensure operational safety and compliance with industrial regulations in India. This results in reduced downtime, predictable costs, and a stable environment that lets teams focus on productivity instead of firefighting operational issues.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Environmentally Responsible Design That Enhances Long-Term Operational Value</h2>
<p>Sustainability and efficiency go hand-in-hand. As global supply chains become more ESG-conscious, tenants operating out of IGBC-certified industrial parks like those developed by KSH INFRA are better positioned to meet environmental benchmarks without incurring additional costs. These parks incorporate renewable energy systems, LED-based smart lighting, and rainwater harvesting mechanisms, which collectively reduce utility consumption over time. The use of green building materials and waste management systems ensures that tenants benefit from lower operating costs while simultaneously improving their ESG performance and audit readiness. The ability to align with global sustainability norms while operating efficiently gives KSH INFRA tenants a distinct long-term advantage in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/physical-security-manufacturing-why-its-more-than-just-barriers-8ykrf/">global manufacturing</a> and distribution networks.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Smart Master Planning That Supports Scalability and Smooth Workflow</h2>
<p>Beyond just the building specs, KSH INFRA’s developments are master planned for performance at scale. Roads are built wide enough for container trucks to turn easily, entry and exit gates are motorized for high-throughput access control, and parking areas are designated to avoid congestion during peak hours. The layouts allow businesses to optimize for both inbound and outbound flow, ensuring smooth loading dock operations, easy forklift navigation, and quick access to inventory zones. This level of design intelligence is what transforms a basic warehouse into an operationally efficient logistics park — one that can grow with the tenant’s business without needing relocation.</p>
<hr />
<h2>A Partner-Led Approach to Infrastructure That Supports Long-Term Business Growth</h2>
<p>KSH INFRA doesn’t stop at infrastructure handover — it actively supports tenants with regulatory guidance, phased expansion planning, and customized upgrades. The developer is known for its professional park management, which focuses on long-term value creation for every client. From handling compliance formalities and fire safety certifications to providing consistent maintenance and security, the support systems at each KSH INFRA park ensure tenants can scale confidently and sustainably. This partner-led approach is one reason leading logistics, e-commerce, and manufacturing companies in India continue to rely on KSH INFRA as a long-term infrastructure ally.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Infrastructure That Works as Hard as You Do</h2>
<p>In the current industrial landscape, real operational efficiency requires more than just square footage — it demands a thoughtful integration of location, infrastructure, sustainability, and support. KSH INFRA’s industrial and logistics parks in Pune and Tamil Nadu have been built with this philosophy at their core. By choosing to operate out of a KSH INFRA park, businesses gain access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic connectivity to key Indian markets</li>
<li>Purpose-built infrastructure that optimizes cost and speed</li>
<li>Reliability that reduces risk and increases throughput</li>
<li>Sustainability features that future-proof operations</li>
<li>A partner who understands the value of long-term tenant success</li>
</ul>
<p>As India rises to become a global industrial and logistics hub, developers like <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/">KSH INFRA</a> are building the backbone of this transformation — one that delivers not just space, but smart, efficient, and future-ready ecosystems for growth.</p>

<h2>Productivity Gains Through Thoughtful Ergonomic Design</h2>
<p>An ergonomic workspace isn&#8217;t a luxury; it&#8217;s a necessity for driving productivity. Poorly designed environments, where workers endure repetitive motions or awkward postures, lead to fatigue and inefficiencies. Conversely, facilities that prioritize ergonomics streamline operations by eliminating unnecessary physical effort and minimising wasted time.</p>
<p>KSH INFRA integrates these principles into its industrial parks. Our layouts are designed to support seamless workflows, with strategically placed storage areas and customisable workspaces that adapt to tenant needs. These features enable businesses to achieve operational efficiency while fostering a work environment that respects the capabilities and limitations of their teams.</p>
<h2>Mitigating Risks: Ergonomics as a Pillar of Workplace Safety</h2>
<p>The physical demands of industrial work are significant, and without ergonomic measures, the risk of injuries such as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and repetitive strain injuries increases exponentially. A well-designed workspace reduces these risks by enabling safer, more natural movements and minimising physical strain.</p>
<p>At KSH INFRA, safety is embedded in our infrastructure. Features such as anti-slip flooring, optimal lighting, and advanced material handling systems are standard across our parks. These elements not only reduce the likelihood of accidents but also ensure that workers can perform their tasks efficiently without compromising their health. By addressing safety at the design stage, we help our tenants create environments where risks are mitigated, and worker confidence is elevated.</p>
<h2>Integrating Ergonomics into Industrial Park Design</h2>
<p>Designing an ergonomic industrial park requires a holistic approach. It&#8217;s not just about individual workstations but the <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/eco-efficient-and-advanced-how-built-to-suit-grade-a-facilities-drive-the-future-of-manufacturing/">entire ecosystem in which tasks are performed</a>. At KSH INFRA, we embed ergonomic principles into every facet of our facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficient Layouts</strong>: Thoughtfully planned spaces minimise unnecessary movement, reducing physical strain and increasing productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Customisable Infrastructure</strong>: Adjustable shelving and modular workstations provide tenants the flexibility to cater to their specific operational needs.</li>
<li><strong>Worker-Centric Rest Areas</strong>: Dedicated spaces for rest and recovery help combat fatigue and improve overall well-being.</li>

</ul>
<p>These features, when combined, create an environment where workers can perform at their best, and businesses can thrive without compromising on safety or efficiency.</p>
<h2>Broader Implications of Ergonomics for Businesses</h2>
<p>The benefits of ergonomic workspaces extend beyond day-to-day productivity. A workforce that feels valued and supported is more engaged, less prone to absenteeism, and less likely to experience job-related injuries. These outcomes translate into long-term cost savings for businesses through reduced healthcare expenses and lower employee turnover rates.</p>
<p>For tenants o KSH INFRA&#8217;s industrial parks, these benefits are within reach. By choosing facilities that are designed with ergonomic considerations at their core, businesses gain a competitive advantage in fostering a workplace culture that prioritises people as much as performance.</p>
<h2>A Partner in Building Safer, More Productive Workspaces</h2>
<p>Ergonomics is not an optional feature—it is a cornerstone of effective industrial operations. At KSH INFRA, we go beyond constructing spaces; we design environments that enable businesses and their workforce to thrive. With a steadfast commitment to ergonomic excellence, we equip our tenants with state-of-the-art infrastructure that enhances both productivity and safety.

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->23:T1411,<p>Lean manufacturing has become a key approach for companies looking to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and build streamlined operations. As manufacturers strive to adopt lean principles, the environment where they operate plays a huge role in how well those principles too are implemented. Grade A industrial parks provide manufacturers with the infrastructure and tools needed to make lean manufacturing not only possible but highly effective.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at how these advanced industrial spaces help support the seven principles of lean manufacturing.</p>
<h2>Eliminate Waste</h2>
<p>The first principle of lean manufacturing is to cut out waste in every form. Grade A industrial parks are built with waste reduction in mind from the very beginning. These parks are designed to have optimal layouts that minimise unnecessary movement of materials and people. They also come with advanced waste management systems, making it easier for companies to reduce material waste and energy inefficiencies.<br />
For example, <strong>KSH INFRA&#8217;s industrial parks</strong> use sustainable practices like energy-efficient lighting, rainwater harvesting, and smart technology to help reduce operational waste, allowing companies to focus on their core business without worrying about excess energy consumption.</p>
<h2>Build Quality In</h2>
<p>High-quality production doesn&#8217;t happen by chance; it has to be designed into the system. Grade A parks offer state-of-the-art facilities that help manufacturers maintain top-quality standards. From advanced automation systems to real-time monitoring technology, these parks help ensure that potential defects are identified and addressed early in the production process.<br />
With high-tech infrastructure, <strong>KSH INFRA&#8217;s Grade A parks</strong> allow manufacturers to build in quality at every stage, leading to fewer mistakes and a smoother workflow.</p>
<h2>Create Knowledge</h2>
<p>Another important aspect of lean manufacturing is the continuous creation and sharing of knowledge. Grade A industrial parks often have built-in spaces that encourage collaboration between teams, fostering innovation and knowledge-sharing across industries. These parks are typically located near educational institutions and research centres, giving businesses access to cutting-edge knowledge and a pool of highly skilled labour.<br />
At <strong>KSH INFRA&#8217;s parks</strong>, manufacturers are part of a community that encourages constant learning and development, helping companies stay innovative and ahead of the curve.</p>
<h2>Defer Commitment</h2>
<p>One of the key ideas in lean thinking is delaying decisions until you have enough data to make the best choice. Grade A industrial parks make it easier for manufacturers to defer major commitments like large capital expenditures. With customisable, build-to-suit facilities, companies can scale their operations as needed rather than investing in large-scale infrastructure upfront. This flexibility allows businesses to grow at their own pace while keeping costs in check.</p>
<h2>Deliver Fast</h2>
<p>In lean manufacturing, speed and efficiency are critical. Grade A industrial parks are located in strategic areas that make it easier for manufacturers to deliver goods quickly. Proximity to major highways, airports, and ports ensures faster transportation times. On top of that, internal road networks and logistics systems are optimized to support rapid movement within the park itself, so products can be shipped out more efficiently.</p>
<h2>Respect People</h2>
<p>People are at the heart of lean manufacturing, and Grade A industrial parks take this principle seriously. These parks are designed with the well-being of employees in mind. From ergonomic workspaces to green recreational areas, these parks provide environments that promote worker health and satisfaction. Plus, the safety standards are top-notch, meaning employees can do their jobs in secure and well-maintained facilities, which boosts morale and productivity.</p>
<h2>Optimise the Whole</h2>
<p>Finally, lean manufacturing focuses on optimising the entire production system. Grade A industrial parks make this easier by creating ecosystems where manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers can work closely together. This helps streamline operations across the entire supply chain. Moreover, these parks integrate sustainability into their designs, using energy-efficient technologies and green building materials, which helps companies optimise their operations while reducing their environmental footprint.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Grade A industrial parks are much more than just real estate—they&#8217;re critical enablers of lean manufacturing. By offering advanced infrastructure, flexible space, and innovative design, they help manufacturers implement lean principles across the board. <strong>KSH INFRA </strong>is committed to delivering these state-of-the-art industrial spaces that not only support lean manufacturing but also foster growth, innovation, and sustainability for the companies that call them home.</p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->25:T1726,<p>Imagine a place where safety transcends the usual checks and measures—where each worker confidently steps onto the floor, knowing they are truly protected. This is not just an ideal; it&#8217;s a necessary foundation for any manufacturing facility that values its people as much as productivity. In this environment, physical security isn&#8217;t just about safeguarding assets; it&#8217;s about fostering a culture of care and vigilance.</p>
<h2>Recognising Common Risks</h2>
<p>Factories are bustling environments, and with that comes the need for proactive safety measures. Ensuring protection against equipment issues, unauthorized access, and maintaining the security of your workplace can prevent potential disruptions. Most importantly, creating a safe and secure space helps foster a positive atmosphere where employees feel protected and confident in their surroundings, regardless of the operation’s size.</p>
<h2>Key Physical Security Measures That Matter in the INFRA Industry</h2>
<p>In the infrastructure industry, security is more than just a formality—it&#8217;s the foundation for protecting assets, ensuring operational continuity, and safeguarding employees and visitors. Effective security systems are those that blend seamlessly with daily operations, offering protection without creating barriers for the people who rely on them. Here are some key physical security measures that make a real difference in ensuring a secure environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access Control: More Than a Barrier</strong><br />
Access control is like the gatekeeper of your facility, ensuring that only authorised personnel can enter specific areas. However, it’s not just about keeping intruders out. It’s about creating a smooth, hassle-free entry for those who need access, improving both security and convenience. A well-implemented access control system makes sure the right people can get where they need to be while preventing unauthorised access without disrupting day-to-day operations.</li>
<li><strong>Surveillance That Works: More Than Just Cameras</strong><br />
Surveillance systems are essential, but they must do more than just tick a box. Security cameras should act as your eyes in places you can’t physically be, providing real-time insights into what’s happening across your facility. Effective surveillance isn’t just about footage—it’s about providing a sense of safety to everyone on-site. When people know there’s a watchful eye, it fosters a sense of security.</li>
<li><strong>A Human Touch: The Role of Security Personnel</strong><br />
While technology plays a vital role, there’s no replacement for the human element in security. Trained security staff don’t just react when something goes wrong—they create an environment of safety and trust. Their presence is a reminder that the facility is under careful watch, providing peace of mind for everyone within the premises.</li>
<li><strong>Perimeter Security: Your First Line of Defense</strong><br />
Perimeter security—fences, lighting, barriers—often forms the first line of defense for a facility. But beyond that, these features create a psychological sense of safety for those inside. Strong perimeter defenses signal that the space is protected from external threats, contributing to an overall feeling of security for employees, contractors, and visitors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Leveraging Technology for Smarter Security</h2>
<p>Technology is transforming physical security in the infrastructure sector, offering smarter, more efficient ways to protect facilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Sensors: The Silent Watchdogs</strong><br />
Think of smart sensors as invisible sentinels. These devices can detect unusual activity and immediately alert your security team to any irregularities. Whether it’s an unexpected entry or an environmental anomaly, smart sensors provide continuous monitoring and quick alerts, helping prevent security breaches before they escalate.</li>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Security: Staying One Step Ahead</strong><br />
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into security systems to predict and prevent potential threats. AI isn’t about replacing human intuition but enhancing it. By analysing patterns, AI can identify unusual behavior and alert security personnel before an incident occurs, allowing for a more proactive security approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building a Layered Defense: The Key to Comprehensive Security</h2>
<p>The most effective security systems don’t rely on a single method. Instead, they incorporate multiple layers of defense—physical barriers, technology, and human oversight—to create a system that’s hard to breach. Layered security means that if one line of defense fails, another is in place to catch the threat. Combining smart technology with physical measures and vigilant security personnel ensures a robust security environment that protects infrastructure from all angles.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Securing the Future of INFRA</h2>
<p>In an industry where safety and reliability are paramount, physical security is more than just a checklist item—it’s a strategic priority. By integrating access control, effective surveillance, human oversight, and cutting-edge technology, infrastructure companies can ensure their facilities remain secure, productive, and prepared for the future.<br />
Incorporating a layered security approach allows businesses to stay ahead of potential threats, offering peace of mind to everyone on-site while protecting critical assets.</p>
<h2>Call to Action</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re considering improving your facility&#8217;s security, consider the people who walk through your doors every day. What&#8217;s their experience like? Are they confident in the systems you have in place? By focusing on these questions, you can build a space where safety and efficiency go hand in hand.</p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->35:T1478,<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the tapestry of economic development, <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/parks/">Grade A industrial parks</a> are vibrant threads, weaving together opportunities for jobs, growth, and comprehensive societal advancement. These parks are more than just business hubs; they are catalysts for transformation within their respective regions, driving economic, technological, and social progress. This blog delves into the multifaceted socioeconomic impacts of such industrial zones, highlighting their instrumental role in shaping prosperous communities and economies.</p>
<h2>Key Socioeconomic Impacts</h2>
<p><strong>Job Creation</strong><br />
One of the most immediate and visible benefits of Grade A industrial parks is the significant employment opportunities they generate. By attracting a diverse array of businesses, these parks create a demand for a wide range of skills, offering both skilled and unskilled positions that can substantially reduce local unemployment rates. The ripple effect of job creation extends beyond the individual, positively impacting families and communities at large.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Growth</strong><br />
Industrial parks serve as engines of <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/unpacking-indias-industrial-and-logistics-sector-growth-2024-insights-from-ksh-infra/">economic growth</a>, catalyzing the flow of investments and fostering an entrepreneurial ecosystem. The concentration of businesses within these parks stimulates local economies, enhancing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and facilitating a thriving economic environment. This growth is not confined to the industrial sector alone; it spills over to ancillary businesses and service providers, contributing to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/elevating-indias-industrial-infra-landscape-ksh-infra-ozhkf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robust economic landscape</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Transfer and Innovation</strong><br />
The aggregation of industries within these parks fosters an environment ripe for innovation and technology transfer. Companies situated in industrial parks often have access to state-of-the-art technology and are part of a network that encourages the exchange of ideas and best practices. This culture of innovation not only enhances the competitiveness of businesses on a global scale but also propels the local industry forward.</p>
<h2>Socioeconomic Impact of Investing in Industrial Areas</h2>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Development</strong><br />
The establishment of industrial parks necessitates the development of essential infrastructure, including transportation networks, utilities, and other facilities. These developments benefit not only the businesses within the parks but also the surrounding communities, improving access to services and enhancing the quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Community Development and Poverty Alleviation</strong><br />
Investments in industrial parks contribute significantly to community development and poverty alleviation. The creation of jobs provides stable income sources for individuals, lifting families out of poverty and fostering an improved standard of living. Additionally, many industrial parks engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, further supporting the socioeconomic development of nearby areas.</p>
<p><strong>Skills Development</strong><br />
The demand for a skilled workforce within industrial parks leads to increased opportunities for training and education. Businesses often invest in skills development programs, enhancing the employability and productivity of the local workforce. This focus on capacity building ensures that the benefits of industrial growth are sustainable and far-reaching.</p>
<h2>KSH Infra&#8217;s JV with MIDC: A Paradigm of Industrial Synergy</h2>
<p>A shining example of the positive <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/ksh-infras-strategic-impact-shaping-indias-industrial-growth-with-grade-a-infrastructure/">impact of Grade A industrial parks</a> is the joint venture between KSH Infra and the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) for a 100-acre development in Talegaon. This collaboration is set to create over 4,000 jobs, inject INR 900 Cr into the local economy and catalyze unprecedented growth in the region. KSH Infra&#8217;s commitment to excellence and <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/sustainability-in-industrial-infrastructure-driving-green-development-at-ksh-infra/">sustainable development</a>, coupled with MIDC&#8217;s strategic vision, promises to transform Maharashtra&#8217;s industrial landscape, offering a brighter future for businesses and communities alike.</p>

The collaboration between KSH Infra and MIDC in Talegaon is a testament to the transformative power of strategic partnerships in industrial development.

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->39:T1310,<p>India&#8217;s industrial and logistics sector is undergoing a significant transformation, marking an impressive growth trajectory. At KSH Infra, we have been closely monitoring these developments. Our insights aim to shed light on the dynamic factors and emerging trends that are shaping this sector.</p>
<h2>2023 Sector Analysis:</h2>
<p>In 2023, the sector witnessed a remarkable 6.7% increase in absorption, reaching a notable 49 million sq ft. This growth was predominantly seen in Tier I cities, accounting for 75% of this expansion. This statistic underscores the vital role of major urban centers in driving the sector&#8217;s growth.</p>
<h2>Rising Demand in Various Sectors:</h2>
<p>The increase in demand across the sector is multifaceted, primarily driven by key areas such as manufacturing, retail, and third-party logistics (3PL). Government initiatives like &#8216;Make in India&#8217; and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme have acted as significant catalysts, boosting sectoral growth and enhancing India&#8217;s appeal as a <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/grade-a-industrial-parks-like-ksh-chakan-park-iii-are-modernizing-indias-manufacturing-sector-by-providing-eco-friendly-and-efficient-facilities/">manufacturing and logistics hub</a>.</p>
<h2>Supply Dynamics in 2023:</h2>
<p>The year 2023 also saw a surge in supply, with an addition of 62 million sq ft to the market. Notably, the majority of this new supply, around 75%, originated from Tier I cities. This increase in supply is a direct response to the growing demand and an indicator of the confidence of major developers in the sector&#8217;s potential.</p>
<h2>Evolution of Grade A Spaces:</h2>
<p>The industrial and logistics sector is witnessing a notable shift towards high-quality, compliant infrastructure. In 2023, <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/grade-a-industrial-parks-like-ksh-chakan-park-iii-are-modernizing-indias-manufacturing-sector-by-providing-eco-friendly-and-efficient-facilities/">Grade A spaces</a>, known for their superior standards and amenities, accounted for 53% of the total market supply, a significant increase from 48% in the previous year. This trend highlights an increasing preference for premium, well-equipped spaces, reflecting a maturing market and evolving customer expectations.</p>
<h2>Forecast for 2024 and Beyond:</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, the growth trajectory for India&#8217;s industrial and logistics sector appears robust. The 3PL and manufacturing sectors, in particular, are poised to drive this expansion. We anticipate the absorption rate to exceed 13%, with supply growth potentially surpassing 14%. This optimistic forecast is underpinned by the continued evolution of the sector and supportive governmental policies.</p>
<h2>E-commerce Impact on Warehousing:</h2>
<p>E-commerce has been a game changer for the warehousing segment. Its influence extends beyond traditional urban centers, stimulating significant growth in Tier II and III cities. The sector&#8217;s contribution to warehousing and logistics is set to see a considerable increase, a testament to the expanding reach and innovative business models of <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/blogs/the-distinction-between-grade-a-and-stantard-warehouses-what-e-commerce-industry-needs-to-know/">e-commerce</a> companies. This trend underscores the evolving landscape of Indian warehousing, transitioning from conventional storage solutions to more advanced, technology-driven facilities.</p>
<h2>Regional Highlights and Trends:</h2>
<p>Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Pune have emerged as the powerhouses in the industrial and logistics sector, contributing significantly to the overall growth. However, the momentum is wider than these metros. We are witnessing a gradual but definitive shift towards other urban and semi-urban areas. This expansion diversifies the sector&#8217;s geographic footprint, indicating a more inclusive growth pattern across the country.</p>
<h2>Future of Rental Values:</h2>
<p>In the coming year, we expect a marginal rise in rental values for compliant buildings. This increase, however, will vary based on location, reflecting the differing regional dynamics and demand patterns.</p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>India&#8217;s industrial and logistics sector is on the brink of a transformative phase. With rapid growth, evolving market dynamics, and increasing diversification, stakeholders must stay informed and agile. Adapting to these changes will be vital to capitalizing on the opportunities this sector presents.</p>

For more insights and to explore collaboration opportunities, we invite you to connect with us and join in shaping the future of India&#8217;s industrial and logistics landscape.</p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->3b:Te15,<p>The e-commerce industry&#8217;s rapid growth has brought an increasing demand for warehousing solutions. As companies strive to optimize their supply chains, the choice of warehouse grade becomes crucial. This article will explore the key differences between Grade A and Stantard warehouses and their implications for e-commerce businesses.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure &amp; Construction Quality</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade A Warehouses: </strong> These facilities are the pinnacle of modern warehousing, built to international standards. They boast high ceilings suitable for modern racking systems and are equipped to handle heavy machinery. Their construction quality is top-notch, ensuring durability and longevity.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Warehouses:</strong> Often older, these warehouses might need more of the refinements of their Grade A counterparts. They serve the purpose but may need to be optimized for the latest warehousing practices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Location</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade A:</strong> These warehouses are strategically located and ensure quick access to major transport routes, urban centres, and other logistical hubs.</li>
<li><strong>Standard:</strong> These might be situated farther from key areas, potentially leading to longer transportation times and increased costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Facilities &amp; Amenities</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade A:</strong> With state-of-the-art facilities, these warehouses might offer temperature control, advanced fire safety systems, and efficient loading docks. They also consider the well-being of workers with amenities like canteens.</li>
<li><strong>Standard:</strong> While functional, they might lack some advanced facilities, making them less versatile for diverse storage needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology Integration</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade A:</strong> Seamlessly integrated with modern tech solutions, these warehouses offer advanced inventory management and security systems.</li>
<li><strong>Standard:</strong> They might serve basic storage needs but could lag in technological integration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintenance &amp; Upkeep</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade A:</strong> Regular maintenance ensures these warehouses remain in optimal condition, safeguarding goods and ensuring smooth operations.</li>
<li><strong>Standard:</strong> The level of upkeep might vary, potentially leading to wear and tear over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implications for E-commerce</h2>
<p>For e-commerce businesses, the choice of warehouse can impact efficiency, costs, scalability, reputation, and the ability to cater to specialized storage needs. While <a href="https://www.kshinfra.com/parks/">Grade A warehouses</a> come with a higher price tag, their advantages, especially in terms of efficiency and scalability, can significantly outweigh the costs for growing e-commerce businesses.</p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->44:Tad3,<h2>TALEGAON MIDC PUNE,<br />
A NEW INDUSTRIAL WORLD IN THE MAKING.</h2>
<p>Talegaon in Pune is an upcoming industrial and warehousing neighborhood. With close proximity to Chakan, the region is home to some of the largest engineering companies such as JCB, General Motors, L&amp;T, POSCO, Emerson, PERI and Continental. This location has attracted engineering talent in abundance. A healthy diaspora of talented individuals from across India and from far corners of the globe, makes Talegaon a preferred destination for auto makers and other diverse industries alike. The region is in close proximity to the Port of JNPT in Mumbai and is within striking distance of Mumbai Metropolitan Region.</p>
<h2>TALEGAON MIDC INFRASTRUCTURE</h2>
<p>Talegaon is an emerging warehousing destination in India due to its proximity to all major highways connecting the State of Maharashtra. MIDC (Maharashtra Regional Development Corporation) has large plans for the region, and the total development planned in the area will exceed 10,000 acres when fully completed. Talegoan has already established itself as a self-sufficient residential domain with several residential complexes, hospitals, schools, colleges and restaurants. A large number of Talegaon residents work in the manufacturing and IT domains.</p>
<h2>TALEGAON MIDC CONNECTIVITY</h2>
<p>One of the main advantages of Talegaon MIDC is that it is located just off the Pune-Mumbai highway which ensures quick connectivity to Mumbai International Airport, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) and the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. This makes international trade and logistics very convenient. Major industrial belts like Pimpri-Chinchwad Industrial Area and Chakan Industrial Area are directly connected to Talegaon MIDC via a network of well-developed roads. This also makes the movement of trucks and other heavy vehicles very easy. The renowned Hinjawadi IT Park is within a short driving distance.</p>
<p><strong>KEY DISTANCES</strong><br />
Chakan MIDC- 11 Km<br />
PCMC Industrial Area- 25 Km<br />
Mumbai-Pune Expressway- 8 Km<br />
Pune City- 40 Km<br />
Pune Airport- 45 Km<br />
Navi Mumbai- 100 Km<br />
JNPT Sea Port- 100 Km<br />
Navi Mumbai International Airport- 105 Km</p>
<h2>INDUSTRIAL PARK IN TALEGAON MIDC BY KSH INFRA</h2>
<p>Talegaon Park 1, the first infrastructure park by KSH Infra, is a small scale development with 2 standalone structures spanning 1,40,952 SQ FT. Though a boutique venture, nothing about the park is ordinary. Grade-A facilities, be it the construction, security, internal roads or amenities, have led to the success of this park and resulted in KSH Infra attracting some of the largest global investors to its platform like JCB, Renault, Klingspor and Unisource.</p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->46:Td3e,<p>Pune is no alien territory for MNCs. Over the last decade, the number of German companies in Pune have doubled from 150 to 300 with leading names like Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Bosch among them. Pune is a multi-industrial hub dominated by the automobile and ancillary companies. Over the last few years, new sectors like electronics, bio-technology and high-tech manufacturing are coming up rapidly. It is no secret that establishing manufacturing plants, warehouses and associated infrastructure costs exorbitant amounts of money and demands heavy paperwork. Considering these factors, majority of manufacturers, both Indian and global, have opted for the more cost efficient and hassle-free option of renting out ready-to-move industrial spaces.</p>
<p>Let’s explore some of the key benefits of exercising this option.</p>
<h2>CAPITAL EXPENDITURE VS OPERATING EXPENSES</h2>
<p>During the start-up phase of operations, a company’s business plan is always under the clouds of uncertainty. They are generally new to the market/country and hence have little knowledge of how they would ramp up, and to mitigate the unforeseen risks they tend to go for a lease option. Many companies prefer ready-to-move facilities against incurring heavy capital expenditure in the initial years of operations, as it is easier on their balance sheet.</p>
<h2>LAND ACQUISITION</h2>
<p>Land acquisition issues are plenty in India and large multinational companies have struggled to get the right land parcel clear of all encumbrances in India. This has been a major pain point for most companies looking to set up operations in India, and hence leasing option is being looked at favourably.</p>
<h2>MULTIPLE ESTABLISHMENTS</h2>
<p>Companies are looking to set up more than one plant, and the concept of setting up mother plants is no longer as prevalent as in the past. Nowadays companies are setting up smaller plants close to the consumer markets. Ramping up operations across multiple leased facilities across a market as geographically diverse as India is also far easier than setting up company owned facilities, due to which they are choosing a leasing option.</p>
<h2>GRADE-A DEVELOPERS &amp; FACILITIES</h2>
<p>Grade-A industrial parks offer global standard features, infrastructure and security. Wealth of A-grade developers in India has given multinational companies more options to choose from, and It has now become the norm for companies to evaluate both leased and owned options when taking decisions.</p>
<h2>AMENITIES</h2>
<p>Smaller multinational companies also prefer going to an Industrial park due to various amenities that are available, and costs being lower as opposed to setting up standalone facilities. The concept of setting up standalone utilities as opposed to using park level ones, also impacts overall costs and multinational companies are now becoming more and more aware of these added features that are available at larger industrial parks. Multi-client facilities offer shared resources that reduce operational costs.</p>
<p>With all the advantages that ready-to-move industrial parks offer, why should a company be burdened by unnecessary expenses incurred in building its own facility? KSH Infra has provided several Grade-A industrial spaces to clients like Kawasaki, Kimberley Clark, JCB, Bosch and many more in Pune, and the numbers are only increasing.</p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->48:Td49,<h2>A COLLABORATION<br />
FOR A GREENER WORLD.</h2>
<p>Rapid development, growing population and urbanization trends are resulting in rapid real estate development across various sectors, be it residential, commercial or industrial. Most of this development is seen in emerging markets and India is one of them. Existing buildings today consume 40 percent of the total electricity globally and generate 19 percent of energy-related GHG emissions. Year on year, pressure on the environment is growing and sustainable development is the only way forward. Currently, green building is not mandatory and hence only a handful of buildings are certified as green. Developers and consumers are not aware of the financial benefits of resource-efficient and sustainable buildings. To embrace greener development systems, resource-efficient building practices must be introduced and implemented. Green construction can reduce emissions, save building material and conserve water &amp; energy for decades.</p>
<p>Even if one wishes to develop sustainable buildings, how would one know the exact requirements to achieve this? Is there a governing law or mandate that states what exactly is necessary? Can an existing building be transformed into a sustainable building? Although many such complex questions may arise while considering green building initiatives, the answer is simple…</p>
<h2>EXCELLENCE IN DESIGN FOR GREATER EFFICIENCIES</h2>
<p>EDGE is an online platform, a green building standard and a certification system. The EDGE application helps to determine the most cost-effective options for designing green within a local climate context. EDGE can be used for buildings of all vintages, including new construction, existing buildings and major retrofits. EDGE is a unique innovation of IFC (INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION), member of the World Bank Group. It has already been adopted in over 150 countries. EDGE was created with the intent to offer a simplistic and yet measurable solution to make a positive business case for building green.</p>
<p><strong>KSH</strong> is an organization that does not shy away from accepting change or learning new ways. After developing a couple of industrial parks, the core leadership at KSH realized the need for green building, given the amount of resources that are consumed every day. We have pledged to adopt and implement sustainable development in all ongoing and future developments. Now equipped with the EDGE Certification, we are on a mission to develop highly efficient and sustainable industrial and warehousing infrastructure. KSH Chakan Park 2 is one of only few industrial parks across Pune that offer ecologically <strong>sustainable infrastructure.</strong> At present, all buildings within Chakan Park 2 have been preliminarily assessed and certified by EDGE. The projected savings are quite impressive and will drastically reduce environmental pressure. In addition to this, it will also shrink operational costs and benefit clients. KSH would also execute a massive plantation drive with over a <strong>1000 trees</strong> planted within the premises by team members and leaders alike to create a fresh and aesthetically appealing work environment.</p>
<p>India, being on the verge of becoming a global power, all industries owe it to the future generations to develop responsibly and we at KSH are committed to playing our part.</p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->4a:Tc43,<p>KSH Multi Modal Logistics &#038; Industrial Parks are designed and built from the groups experience in managing complex logistics operations, building and operating Inland Container Depots. KSH parks offer Grade-A infrastructure in the form of built-to-suit and customisable buildings as per client requirements. The park features and facilities lay a great impetus on environmental sustainability, well planned layout with wide roads for easy maneuverability of trucks, adequate parking spaces, high ceilings, large column spacing for logistics as well as manufacturing companies, water and electricity, sewage treatment plants, effluent treatment plants, office blocks, canteens etc.</p>
<p>KSH Chakan Park 2 is divided into 2 different parks, Park-A and Park-B. These 2 parks all together have 5 buildings named A1, A2, A3, B1 &#038; B2 out of which 2 have received the EDGE ADVANCED PRELIMINARY CERTIFICATE and 3 have received EDGE PRELIMINARY CERTIFICATE.</p>
<h2>LET’S VIEW THE MAIN FACTORS THAT EDGE CONSIDERS ESSENTIAL FOR A BUILDING TO QUALIFY AS SUSTAINABLE.</h2>
<p><strong>ENERGY</strong><br />
Buildings by nature are energy intensive, even a small amount of saving can go a long way and make a substantial impact. EDGE being developed for emerging economies focuses on primary issues, energy consumption being one of the priorities amongst them.</p>
<p>All the projects part of the Chakan Park have been designed to save on massive amounts of energy consumption. This has increased the capital cost very marginally, however, the saving in the operational cost is substantial as compared to a non-EDGE certified building of similar proportion.</p>
<p><strong>WATER</strong><br />
Water would qualify as one of the most critical factors to the life force, however, an infinitely misused resource at the same time. We have regularly been facing draughts every year in various regions of the Indian subcontinent and it is our moral responsibility to take conscious steps towards conserving water.<br />
Something as simple as a low flow faucet can potentially save 50% of water consumption (through taps for hand wash or dish wash)</p>
<p><strong>EMBODIED ENERGY IN MATERIALS</strong><br />
The environmental impacts of materials vary according to where and how they are manufactured, processed and used. Due to the global scope of EDGE, the data for embodied energy of construction materials based on a life cycle assessment (LCA) model. A complex combination of many processed materials determines a building’s total embodied energy.</p>
<p>Some of the sustainability features at KSH Chakan Park 2 include optimised window to wall ratio, Energy saving light bulbs – LED, Water efficient – faucets, urinals, Water closets, Black water recycling in which the recycled water will be used for flushing &#038; landscaping purposes. Use of fly ash bricks &#038; AAC blocks for internal &#038; external walls, Aluminium window frames. Since there is no local municipal water supply to the Industrial area where the warehouses are located borewell water will be used for purposes other than flushing &#038; landscaping.</p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->4c:Tbd9,<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted every single industry over the course of just a few months. It has completely changed human life, irrespective of demographics, profession and social status. Many of our habits have changed. Our lifestyle, social connect and work culture have mutated beyond reckoning. While economic slowdown brews on one end, new trends are evolving on the other. A new world is emerging…one that might finally accept that ‘abnormal’ is the ‘new normal’.</p>
<p>While world economies were shaken by the Coronavirus, many industries in India took a hit as well. Lower production, pay reduction and high job &#038; business uncertainty have been spooking every tax paying citizen ever since the onset of the pandemic. But in some sectors, the results are exponentially positive. So adaptability and creative decision making will play a key role in the future sustainability of enterprises.</p>
<p>Many countries, including India, have started resuming work in a tamed environment. India could potentially lead the change in a post-Covid world with its vast array of engineers and investment opportunities, according to billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban. India could be the next biggest global exporter as many countries are looking to shift operations and this is a real opportunity for diversification for India. In such a case, manufacturing companies in India must quickly adapt to the global demands, diversify their supply chain and focusing on product quality. Every sector will have to reinvent itself to survive in a post-COVID-19 world order.<br />
Several companies that incorporated the work-from-home system have now decided to continue it even post lockdown. From delivering work stations to providing high speed internet connectivity, every company working in the digital and tech space has ensured a smooth transition of work culture. This has not just saved on operational costs but also increased productivity. Such transition may never be possible in the manufacturing sectors, however, innovative systems may be designed to enhance processes that do not require physical presence.</p>
<p>India has become the new land of opportunities as foreign companies look to shift base out of other asian counties and into India. As entrepreneurs, we must work along with our government to create internationally acclaimed benchmarks in manufacturing and distribution to portray reliability and attract foreign investments. Expanding domestic capacity and capability in a strategic manner can make all the difference. With a youth population of nearly 230 million, man power and skilled labour can serve as our greatest strengths.</p>
<p><strong>In summary, manufacturing companies need to articulate a measurable roadmap to increase their current domestic value addition. A strategic approach, technological enhancement, skill development and precise market forecast are some of the key focus areas to make India the next preferred global industrial destination post COVID-19.</strong></p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->4e:T9cf,<p>If you can remember one life-threatening situation that you were in, you already know the importance of being safe. Not every hazardous situation is caused by humans. Some occur naturally. It therefore our moral responsibility to create a safe domestic and professional environment.</p>
<p>Safety is one of the most undermined issues in today’s time. Often people prefer comfort to safety, which eventually leads to horrifying accidents. The best examples of these are not wearing a helmet or seat belts. Though everyone is well aware of the consequences of taking unnecessary risks with their lives, they tend to ignore them and proceed anyway, only to regret later. People forget that safety is not an option but a requirement. Above all, our carefree attitude may jeopardize the safety of others. Not to mention the many lives that subsequently get affected.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the government and several leading organisations have created strict safety compliance norms, not just related to work, but also at a social level. Even the ongoing COVID19 pandemic has just one major cure – safety and precaution. This week, the entire nation is celebrating ‘National Safety Week’ to create awareness and instil a sense of responsibility in every citizen. KSH Infra has joined this initiative and each employee is playing his or her part in spreading the message. KSH Infra has developed several industrial spaces, some of which have been naturally challenging and demanding. However, at no point has the safety compliance been defied or compromised for convenience. Our safety protocols include the use of helmets, safety goggles, hand gloves, face shields, safety nets, jackets, breathing masks etc. and apply to all those who step onto our premises. Over the past 7 years, we have engaged a workforce of more than 5000 men and women who have worked for millions of hours without a single reported accident and we aim at maintaining the streak. We have recently taken a step further towards safer futures, not just for people, but also the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Our ongoing industrial park at Chakan comprises of EDGE certified green buildings that reduce the pressure on the environment and conserve natural resources. Our endeavours have been a success due to the diligent and sincere efforts of our team and we could not thank them enough for this.</p>
<p>This week, we light the beacon of safety, but let us promise ourselves to keep the torch burning till eternity.</strong></p>

<!-- / Yoast SEO plugin. -->50:Tcdb,<p>There is no debating the fact that modern buildings put tremendous pressure on the environment. Existing buildings today consume 40 percent of the total electricity globally and generate 19 percent of energy-related GHG emissions. It is therefore essential to adopt green building techniques. As human life came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the earth initiated a self-healing process. Cleaner water, clearer skies, low seismic activities and the influx of wildlife into human habitats are clear indicators of how rapid development was hampering the existence of our natural world and that nature does not need to be saved, only preserved. When the world resumes, we should remember what we owe our planet and embrace a sustainable future.</p>
<p>KSH Chakan Park 2 is among only a few industrial parks in Pune that offer ecologically sustainable infrastructure. All 5 buildings within the park have been preliminarily assessed and certified by Excellence In Design For Greater Efficiencies (EDGE). The projected savings would not just cut down on the pressure that is building on the environment each day, but also reduce operational costs drastically. In addition to this, KSH would also be planting over 1000 trees within the premises to create a fresh and aesthetically appealing work environment.</p>
<h2>LET US BRIEFLY UNDERSTAND HOW KSH INFRA’S SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIAL PARKS CAN BENEFIT YOU AS AN END USER.</h2>
<p><strong>Reduced Operational Costs</strong><br />
Green buildings are designed to enable maximum illumination through natural light during the day, while low consumption LED lights are installed to fill-in when required. Similarly, water-efficient urinals and faucets optimize the use of water with little to no wastage. This results in significant savings through reduced energy and water bills over the life of the building.</p>
<p><strong>Refreshing Workspaces</strong><br />
Ample natural light and ventilation within buildings would create a pleasant and healthy indoor environment for the building occupants. As mentioned above, over a 1000 trees would be planted within the premises of the park, which in turn would result in a lush green and refreshing outdoor ambience. This is likely to improve the productivity of employees and benefit the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Social Image</strong><br />
Manufacturing companies often come under scrutiny due to high emission and energy consumption which many environmentalists and social activists criticize. Consumer behavior is largely affected by a brand’s reputation and its empathy towards the environment. We often see individuals praising or slating organizations for their ethical responsiveness. Moving into a sustainable industrial park exudes a company’s responsibility towards the environment and places it above blatant profiteering firms, thus creating higher value for investors and consumers alike.<br />
Building a sustainable facility is no easy task. Besides procuring land and securing permissions, a proficient team of engineers, architects and technicians with experience in green building must be assigned to the task. So why bother with all the hassles? Opt for a ready to move <strong>sustainable industrial park</strong> developed by KSH Infra at Chakan Pune.</p>
